Automated Teller Machine

The project is an ATM machine that saves users records in a txt file

The code works as below:
create an ATM Machine program that allows a user to choose one of the following introduction menu items:
    1) Create a bank account by supplying a user id and password.
    2) Login using their id and password.
    3) Quit the program.
If login was not successful (for example the id or password did not match) then the user will be taken back to the introduction menu.
Now if login was successful the user will be able to do the following main menu items:
    1) Withdraw money.
    2) Deposit money.
    3) Request balance.
    4) Quit the program.
    
HAVE FUN GOING THROUGH IT!
